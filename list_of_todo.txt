- [ ] Warning thrown when embedding the school data bc there's more than one connected component - is this warning always needed?



## ==== Annie 
- go through dynamic code with ed to eliminate: 
  (1) repeated code (safe_inv_sqrt, to_laplacian), 
  (2) any functions that shouldn't be in documentation need _ 
  (3) consistent in our input arguments: return_left 
  (4) redundancy in the UASE/embed function? 
  (5) animation in lyon  
  (6) should plotting be in its own module? all _ function in utils? should we keep submodules or just have it all load in import 
  (7) how to change the current function to produce As needed for dyn embedding 
  (8) function names
  (9) static plotting?
