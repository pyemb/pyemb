- [ ] Warning thrown when embedding the school data bc there's more than one connected component - is this warning always needed?



## ==== Annie 
- go through dynamic code with ed to eliminate: (1) repeated code (safe_inv_sqrt, to_laplacian), (2) any functions that shouldn't be in documentation need _ (3) consistent in our input arguments: return_left (4) redundancy in the UASE/embed function?
