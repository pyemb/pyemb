** Quality of life
- [ ] Warning thrown when embedding the school data bc there's more than one connected component - is this warning always needed?

** Bugs
- [ ] School legend has the wrong colours for labels
- [ ] dyn_embed returns the wrong shape when flat=False and when using any method that called embed()
- [X] embed() errors when given a matrix of ints
- [X] embed() gives incorrect shapes when flat=False

** Testing
- [ ] Add in a test for each bug 

** To implement
- [ ] A load of Ian's network generation functions from spectral_embedding



## ==== Annie 
- go through dynamic code with ed to eliminate: 

  (2) any functions that shouldn't be in documentation need _ 
all non-user functions in _utils, check hc 



  (3) consistent in our input arguments: return_left 
  (4) redundancy in the UASE/embed function? 
one function ???? 
check embedding that it works ? ? ? -- sparse okay? 

  (5) animation in lyon  
try and see 
  (6) should plotting be in its own module? all _ function in utils? should we keep submodules or just have it all load in import
yes 
  (7) how to change the current function to produce As needed for dyn embedding 
check works
  (8) function names

  (9) static plotting?
